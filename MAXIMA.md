# Maxima project documentation

This is the main technical documentation for Maxima. Keep it current as the
engine evolves. `AGENTS.md` is the quick entry for contributors and coding agents;
optional private context lives in `.context/agents.md`, outside Git.

Keep chapter numbers stable; append new chapters rather than renumbering existing
ones. Use descriptive headings and keep each chapter understandable independently.
Until a dedicated documentation reader exists, list chapters with
`rg '^## ' MAXIMA.md` and locate topics with `rg -n '<term>' MAXIMA.md`.

## 1. Engine and goals

Maxima2 is a C++26 UCI chess engine with bitboard move generation, classical
search and evaluation, and experimental losers-chess support.

### Goals

- Improve playing strength, correctness, performance, and reliability.
- Make clean, understandable code a first-class project goal. Preserve clear
  control flow, explicit state ownership, and coherent interfaces as the engine
  gains capabilities.
- Preserve the engine's focus on speed: efficient chess algorithms, high search
  throughput, and compilation tuned for the target CPU.
- Explore a learned evaluator, such as NNUE, with correctness tests and measured
  playing-strength gains guiding integration into search.
- Strengthen endgame play with verified KPK integration and optional tablebases
  that respect draw rules and work with partial, user-selected coverage.
- Add multithreaded search with explicit ownership of worker state, safe shared
  caches, and reliable cancellation.
- Make the code cleaner through focused refactoring: reduce global mutable
  state, encapsulate invariants, clarify interfaces, and remove misleading or
  unused behavior.
- Preserve chess correctness and existing functionality while improving the
  engine.

These goals guide development; they do not select a parallel search algorithm
or require every task to advance every goal.

## 2. Engineering conventions

- Keep code clean, understandable, and maintainable. Judge simplicity by how
  easily behavior and invariants can be understood and changed safely. Prefer
  focused functions, explicit dependencies, and purposeful abstractions. Explain
  the reasoning behind heuristics and subtle invariants where it helps readers.
- Use snake_case for new project-defined identifiers and filenames. Preserve
  externally defined names, such as UCI commands and options.
- Prioritize missing engine fundamentals and substantial measured strength gains
  over complex changes aimed at marginal Elo improvements.
- Keep heuristics understandable and independently testable. Justify added
  complexity with measured benefits.
- Before implementing or substantially changing a chess algorithm, read the
  relevant [Chess Programming Wiki](https://chessprogramming.org/) articles.
  Follow their references to original papers and engine implementations when
  assessing technical details. Treat
  [NNUE](https://chessprogramming.org/NNUE) and
  [Late Move Reductions](https://chessprogramming.org/Late_Move_Reductions)
  as required reading for their respective workstreams; validate designs and
  tuning choices in Maxima.
- Treat performance as a first-class requirement. Preserve useful low-level
  techniques, including intrinsics and assembly; use profiling and benchmarks
  to guide hot-path changes and compiler choices. Compare Release builds with
  identical positions, limits, and compiler flags, checking NPS, time to depth,
  and playing strength rather than assuming any one metric proves improvement.
- Prefer incremental changes with clear ownership and explicit dependencies.
- Commit each completed, tested increment with its regressions and relevant
  documentation before moving on. Use a one-line Conventional Commit message
  (`type(scope): description`) with no body or footer.
- Keep board representations, hashes, ply counters, and search stacks consistent
  through operations that own their invariants.
- Validate external input before changing engine state. Assertions supplement
  validation; they do not replace it.
- Use atomics or locks for shared mutable state. `volatile` is not thread
  synchronization.
- Support search and evaluation improvements with correctness checks and
  relevant performance or playing-strength evidence. Distinguish measured
  results from assumptions.

## 3. Code layout

- `src/`: engine, UCI handling, board state, move generation, search, evaluation,
  hash tables, time management, and Polyglot opening-book support.
- `src/w17/`: losers-chess search and evaluation.
- `tests/`: tests for bit operations, move generation, search, static exchange
  evaluation, Polyglot keys, hash tables, evaluation, board flipping, and mates.
- `gen/`: KPK bitbase generator.

CMake generates `generated/maxima/version.h` inside each build directory from
`src/version.h.in`. Do not edit generated headers. The generated include directory
propagates to engine-library consumers; any obsolete source-tree `src/version.h`
is ignored and unused.

- `src/tablebase.*`: Maxima's Syzygy adapter and probing policies.
- `third_party/fathom/`: pinned, unmodified MIT-licensed table decoder.
- `runner/`: independently packaged Python CLI, UCI orchestration, suites,
  tablebase downloads, experience tooling, and their tests.
- `tests/data/syzygy/`: small offline tablebase test fixtures.
- `tablebases/syzygy/`: downloaded user tables, ignored by Git.

## 4. Search correctness and caches

Search owns its configuration and pre-root repetition history. Real game history
requires three occurrences; cycles strictly inside search use one earlier match
as a search heuristic. Repetition identity excludes en passant squares when no
legal capture is available. Irreversible moves and null moves bound history scans.
Checkmate takes precedence over a fifty-move draw. Standard quiescence detects
stalemate at every tactical depth, including before a stand-pat cutoff; absence
of captures or promotions alone does not imply stalemate. Standard interior
search also verifies legal play before static beta or null-move pruning can
run, so stalemate remains an exact draw with production pruning enabled. The
probe uses a king escape first and fresh move generation when needed, without
changing the active move picker.

Standard null-move pruning excludes consecutive artificial passes and runs
endgame verification with null pruning disabled throughout its subtree. The
setting and board/history state are restored before handling cancellation;
an interrupted verification cannot authorize a cutoff. Node pruning excludes
mate/tablebase score windows, and artificial null lines cannot supply reserved
mate/tablebase scores as cutoffs. Pawn-only positions retain the non-pawn-material
exclusion. These safeguards do not make selective search an exhaustive oracle.

Static beta and null-move node pruning also stop at reversible clock 99: the
next legal reversible move draws unless it checkmates, while static evaluation
or an artificial pass can incorrectly claim a winning cutoff. Earlier node
pruning restricts its compatible TT clock range through 98; parent entries
inherit that restriction. Legal captures and pawn moves remain searchable.

At the search-stack ceiling, standard PVS and quiescence resolve checkmate,
stalemate, and draws before static evaluation. Royal losers preserves king-only
and draw precedence and resolves checkmate/stalemate wins at its ceiling.
Playable positions, including checks with legal evasions, retain static
evaluation when no further child stack is available. Cancellation retains its
existing precedence; a ceiling evaluation is not a completed deeper search.

Standard quiescence retains castling at entry and below entry, alongside captures
and promotions; entry also searches quiet checks, and checked nodes search all
legal evasions. Nonchecking castles remain subject to delta/SEE pruning.
This is an existing bounded quiet extension, not a certified strength gain.

An exact TT return can shorten the searched PV because an entry stores a score
and move rather than a complete continuation. Search clears the stale PV before
reuse. UCI text may append TT move hints to a short searched prefix; those hints
are not a completed deeper search or a guaranteed line of the cached score.
Ponder selection uses the searched prefix and can therefore be absent.

Per-root ordering/complexity counters use signed 64-bit values to preserve their
initial SEE bias, add unsigned visited work with saturation, and compare without
subtraction. They are ordering estimates; the separate unsigned visited counter
continues to drive UCI nodes and node budgets.

The UCI boundary validates positions and moves before committing the new FEN and
repetition history. `position fen` requires six fields, bounded nonnegative
counters, one king and at most eight pawns per side, valid rank widths, and
consistent castling/en passant metadata. Invalid move sequences reject the
entire command, including `forward`.
Moves must match a generated legal move; losers mode also enforces compulsory
legal captures. Rejected input reports an `info string` diagnostic and leaves the
previous position/history intact.
Material evaluation also bounds its pawn-count adjustment lookup for internal
boards constructed without UCI validation. Promotions remain supported.

`setoption` requires the `name` header and validates integers against advertised
spin bounds, boolean values, and the supported `Wild` selections before changing
options. Invalid `go` numeric limits are rejected without starting another search;
clock values must fit the engine's integer clock representation, and depth is
bounded by its search stack. Time-budget arithmetic avoids signed overflow for
large valid clock values. These checks validate supported input; they do not prove
that an arbitrary FEN is reachable from the initial position.

The engine supports orthodox castling and does not advertise `UCI_Chess960`.
Requests to set that option report `info string Unsupported option: UCI_Chess960`
and preserve options and the position/history. `go mate` limits are unsupported:
the whole request reports `info string Unsupported go limit: mate`, including
when the limit follows `searchmoves`. Rejected requests preserve the previous
search settings and do not start a replacement search. As with other `go` and
`setoption` commands, an active search is stopped and joined first.

UCI output serializes complete lines from the command and search threads, so
readiness responses and search reports cannot merge into a malformed line.
Both centipawn and mate scores retain lower/upper-bound qualifiers. NPS uses
reported nodes per second with the reported monotonic elapsed milliseconds; a
zero-millisecond sample uses a one-millisecond denominator. Rates retain unsigned
64-bit range and saturate if that range is exceeded. Reported nodes count visited
search calls, including quiescence, using the same counter as `go nodes`;
pruned moves are excluded from nodes and NPS. Cancellation suppresses subsequent
full-window re-searches once the first pass has stopped.

Each finished search emits `info string search_result SOURCE completed_depth N
attempted_depth N interrupted 0|1 pruned_moves N`. Sources are `complete`,
`partial`, `fallback`, `book`, `terminal`, or `tablebase`. Completed depth counts
fully finished root iterations; attempted depth can include interrupted work.
The final score and PV depth belong to the selected result, which can remain from
a completed earlier iteration or come from a partially searched root. Partial
root scores use lower bounds; a fail-low score for only a subset of root moves
cannot bound the whole root and is omitted. Only completed root iterations and
terminal/tablebase shortcuts publish exact final scores. Book and legal fallback
moves report depth zero without a score; book selection reports zero nodes.
The engine result snapshot carries the same provenance, bounds and counters.
`interrupted` describes search work, independently of the selected result source;
for example, interruption before evaluating a new root move can leave the previous
completed iteration selected.

Accepted changes to `KingAttackShelter` or `KingAttackPieces` stop and join the
current search, then clear the transposition table before subsequent searches.
Unchanged or rejected values preserve cached scores. Draw contempt remains part
of the TT score context; pawn and material cache entries do not depend on these
king-attack weights and remain reusable.
These are manual UCI tuning weights: 256 preserves the normal contribution,
0 disables it, and 512 doubles it. Search captures the configured values;
the engine does not adjust them automatically during play.

Search deadlines and UCI elapsed times use a monotonic wall clock. Time spent
preparing the search or waiting to run its worker counts toward the budget; a
process pause does not extend the deadline. Pondering suppresses deadline
cancellation until `ponderhit`, preserving elapsed time from the search start.
Explicit zero clocks and `movetime 0` retain a time limit and return a legal
move without requiring `stop`; absent time limits retain untimed search behavior.
`go searchmoves` accepts a nonempty list of legal root moves, including losers'
compulsory-capture rule. It restricts both search and book/experience selection;
illegal or empty lists reject the command. Other supported `go` options can
appear before or after the move list. A search interrupted before evaluating its
first root move returns a legal fallback from that permitted set, rather than
`0000`. This fallback is not a completed evaluation.

In losers chess, king-only wins, checkmate, and stalemate precede draw scoring.
These terminal rules also apply at the UCI root before book lookup: finished
positions report an exact terminal score and `bestmove 0000`. The side to move
wins when both sides have only their kings, matching interior search precedence.
Pondering retains a completed result until `ponderhit` or `stop`; explicit
`infinite` analysis retains it until `stop`, even after `ponderhit`. Depth, node,
and time limits may finish search work but do not authorize these results.
Argument order does not change the limits or infinite intent. This behavior
applies to ordinary searches, terminal roots, and book/tablebase shortcuts.
A bare `go` also waits for `stop`; an explicit depth limit, including 128,
remains bounded. Ordinary bounded searches publish their result when work finishes.
Playable positions reach the fifty-move threshold at 100 halfmoves, including
positions in check; checkmate does not become a draw at higher clock counts.

The transposition table uses 24-byte entries: a full 64-bit position signature,
a 64-bit context fingerprint, and packed move, score, depth, age, and halfmove
clock-range metadata. Move hints can survive a context mismatch, but score
cutoffs require compatible context and clock ranges. Royal-losers score context
also includes the incoming mate-search mode (automatic, White, or Black), whose
horizon rules differ. A node keeps that identity when it changes mode or reduces
depth locally; incompatible modes retain move hints but cannot reuse scores.
Material and pawn caches and the transposition table still need synchronization
before parallel search.

KPK is an embedded win/draw bitbase. Proven draws stop search with the configured
draw score; winning positions retain search because KPK has no distance-to-zero
information. Tests independently verify all legal normalized KPK states.

### Standard NNUE bootstrap

NNUE development lives on `feat/nnue-bootstrap`. HCE remains the standard
chess default/fallback and strength reference; royal-losers remains material-only.
The initial target is pretrained CPU inference, without training or GPU hardware.

Candidate assessment: the current local Stockfish architecture combines HalfKA,
threat and piece-pair features and has substantial position/accumulator coupling.
Other engines' networks require their matching feature sets and inference cores;
`.nnue` does not identify one universal format. The first supported family is
legacy HalfKP, 41024 inputs, two 256-wide accumulators, 512->32->32->1 integer
inference. It has an independently pinned CFish-derived probe for exact reference
checks and a compact board adapter. This is a correctness/bootstrap choice, not
proof of the strongest evaluator or a commitment to this family indefinitely.

Official CC0 bootstrap weights: `nn-62ef826d1a6d.nnue`, full SHA-256
`62ef826d1a6d11b9e814188025aa02a60815c037292e0ef9bbb9bf4f724e5e63`.
Run `python3 tools/download_nnue.py` to fetch and verify them into ignored
`networks/`. The downloader does not change engine defaults. Weight provenance:
https://github.com/official-stockfish/networks. The GPL reference probe revision
and source ownership are recorded in `third_party/nnue_reference/README.md`.

Evaluation contract: standard scores are relative to the side to move, in the
Maxima centipawns, clamped below the tablebase score range. The pinned SF13
core returns internal units: convert with `raw * 100 / 208`, matching its UCI
conversion (`PawnValueEg=208`). Raw/full/incremental inference is checked before
this conversion. Stockfish's separate material, tempo and rule50 scaling is not
imported; any further calibration needs separate strength evidence.
Search retains checks, terminal/draw/tablebase decisions and material/pawn
pruning metadata. HCE tempo, positional terms and endgame score adjustments
must not be added to NNUE scores. Search captures an immutable model snapshot;
mutable accumulators belong to that search. Evaluator/model changes must prevent
reuse of incompatible TT scores. Invalid loads must retain the previous model.
Correctness gates include full/reference/incremental equivalence, special moves,
null moves, restoration and cancellation. Measure CPU throughput and paired
playing strength before changing the default. Parallel-cache work is separate.

The engine now supports `EvalFile` and `UseNNUE` (default false). Load the model
first, then enable NNUE:

```text
setoption name EvalFile value /absolute/path/to/nn-62ef826d1a6d.nnue
setoption name UseNNUE value true
```

Missing/unsupported files report a load failure and retain the previous model.
Enabling without a loaded model is rejected. `EvalFile value <empty>` unloads
and selects HCE; `UseNNUE value false` retains the loaded model while selecting
HCE. Changes stop/join active search and clear incompatible TT entries. Search
score context also fingerprints the model and adapter version, so separately
retained search snapshots cannot reuse another evaluator's score bounds. The
fingerprint is a cache identity, not a cryptographic integrity check; the model
downloader verifies the full pinned SHA-256. Royal-losers ignores standard NNUE.

`src/nnue.cpp` owns the isolated HalfKP loader/inference implementation. Weights
are immutable, accumulators are allocated per search/ply, and updates are lazy.
A changed king refreshes its perspective; captures, promotions, castling and
en passant update the affected non-king features. Null moves exchange output
perspectives without changing features. Unmake restores the parent accumulator.
The loader checks exact size, version and architecture hashes before decoding;
wide affine sums and score clamps keep external weights outside reserved scores.
Native AVX2 feature accumulation and dense inference have scalar fallbacks.
There is no network I/O or Python dependency in the engine or its build.

`test_nnue` runs offline using synthetic weights for load validation, score bounds,
metadata, model lifetime, evaluator/TT isolation and HCE/losers preservation.
To add real-weight independent-probe and NNUE lifecycle checks, configure either
preset with `-Dmaxima_nnue_test_network=/absolute/path/to/nn-62ef826d1a6d.nnue`.
Those checks compare both accumulators and integer scores across special moves,
seeded legal games, skipped parent evaluation, null moves, cancellation and restart.
The lifecycle suite also runs with NNUE enabled and tests reload/disable/unload.
The pinned reference is compiled only for these optional tests. Configure with
`-Dmaxima_nnue_test_network=` to return to the model-independent suite.

For paired A/B games, select `--model-a EvalFile=/absolute/path/to/network.nnue`
and `--option-a UseNNUE=true`; engine B can use the same executable with HCE.
The runner applies model options before evaluator-enabling flags, after validating
both complete configurations, and records the model checksum in the match report.

Bootstrap validation on the local Intel i5-10210U: Debug and Release each
passed their 34-check suite; after the explicit SF13-to-centipawn conversion,
all three NNUE checks passed again in both builds. The reference check covers
3169 position comparisons, with bit-identical raw full/incremental/probe scores
and accumulator values. The separately compiled scalar fallback also passed the
reference and loader/contract checks. ASan/UBSan with leak detection passed all
three corrected NNUE checks, including the 31-scenario lifecycle suite (outside
the restricted sandbox so LeakSanitizer can inspect threads). The runner passed
88/88 with real-engine integration enabled.

Seven alternating Release samples of 20000 warmed evaluations measured a median
0.083828 s with the initial scalar dense path versus 0.031709 s with AVX2 dense
inference (2.64x). A separate five-repeat, three-position, 50000-node search
benchmark measured median 1.471M NPS for HCE and 0.431M for NNUE (29.3%). These
are local workload measurements, not general scaling or playing-strength results.
An eight-game, four-pair 2+0.02s correctness smoke after unit conversion scored
1W/5D/2L versus HCE, with 803 independently verified legal plies and no errors,
unfinished games or forfeits. Both smoke runs used already reserved openings and
are diagnostic only; the earlier raw-unit run is not a strength baseline. Neither
run establishes an Elo gain or justifies changing the default. Further work is
pretrained network quality, model/search score calibration and credible paired
strength measurement. HCE tuning and parallel cache refactoring are not required
first. Reproducible scripts, logs, identities and PGNs are private under
`.context/baselines/2026-10-13/nnue-bootstrap/`; reserve these fixtures from training.

## 5. Build and debugging

The default build uses C++26 and requires a compiler that supports that mode
(tested with GCC 16), CMake 3.30 or newer, and Ninja. Engine lifecycle tests need
Python 3.7+ with its standard library. Configure with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`
to build the engine without Python or test targets. The separately packaged
runner needs Python 3.8+; see chapters 6.1 and 10.
Release builds retain `-O3 -DNDEBUG -march=native`; Debug builds retain assertions
and debug symbols. Fathom is compiled separately as C11; a C compiler is also required.
Native CPU tuning means the binary targets the build machine.

With those tools on your PATH:

```bash
cmake --preset cpp26_release
cmake --build --preset cpp26_release --parallel
ctest --preset cpp26_release
./build/cpp26/release/src/maxima2
```

Use `cpp26_debug` for the corresponding Debug configure, build, and test commands.
Its executable is `build/cpp26/debug/src/maxima2`.

For an isolated Linux toolchain, install [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html), then:

```bash
export MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX="$PWD/.tools/mamba"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$PWD/.tools/cache"
micromamba create -y -p .tools/cpp26 -f cpp26_environment.yml
micromamba run -p .tools/cpp26 cmake --preset cpp26_release
micromamba run -p .tools/cpp26 cmake --build --preset cpp26_release --parallel
micromamba run -p .tools/cpp26 ctest --preset cpp26_release
micromamba run -p .tools/cpp26 ./build/cpp26/release/src/maxima2
```

This workspace's local micromamba executable is `.tools/bootstrap/bin/micromamba`.
The compiler environment lives under `.tools/` and is excluded from Git.
The isolated build links to the C++ runtime in `.tools/cpp26/lib`.
C++26 is required by default; CMake will fail rather than silently select an older
standard. An explicit compatibility build can select `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`.

You can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to develop and debug Maxima2 by installing the
[Remote Development Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### 5.1 Optional Release LTO and GCC PGO

Ordinary builds keep their existing flags. Enable LTO explicitly with
`-Dmaxima_lto=ON`; CMake checks compiler/linker IPO support. LTO applies to
Release targets and allows optimization across source files. GCC PGO is
selected with `-Dmaxima_pgo_mode=generate` or `use` (default `off`) and
`-Dmaxima_pgo_dir=/absolute/path`. PGO requires Release and GCC for both C and
C++. It instruments the engine and Fathom, uses atomic profile counters, and
supplies the profiling runtime to executables linking the engine library.

Start with an isolated LTO build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/cpp26/lto -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS= -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS= \
  -Dmaxima_lto=ON
cmake --build build/cpp26/lto --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/cpp26/lto --output-on-failure
```

Use the toolchain prefix and cache environment from chapter 5 when needed.
Each configuration owns its generated version header in its build directory,
so configuring Debug, Release, or profiling builds cannot overwrite another
configuration's revision/build-type metadata. Freeze each playing binary with
its hash and build settings. Revision metadata is captured at configure time;
reconfigure from the intended clean revision before freezing a baseline binary.

PGO has three steps: build an instrumented engine, train it with representative
searches, then rebuild with the recorded profile. For example, from the repository
root with the compiler environment active:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/cpp26/pgo -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS= -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS= \
  -Dmaxima_pgo_mode=generate -Dmaxima_pgo_dir="$PWD/build/cpp26/profiles"
cmake --build build/cpp26/pgo --target maxima2 --parallel
./maxima suite:run --engine build/cpp26/pgo/src/maxima2 \
  --suite /path/to/training.epd --nodes 500000 --timeout 60
cmake -S . -B build/cpp26/pgo -Dmaxima_pgo_mode=use
cmake --build build/cpp26/pgo --parallel
ctest --test-dir build/cpp26/pgo --output-on-failure
```

The suite runner requires its Python environment. Its standard-chess EPD input
requires a legal `bm`; these moves are suite targets, not instructions selecting
compiler optimizations. A bounded UCI corpus driver can train other variants
without that EPD scoring requirement. Training must wait for each search result
and quit cleanly so GCC writes the `.gcda` profiles. Do not use correctness tests
as the training workload. Configuration rejects an empty profile directory;
compilation rejects missing and incompatible profiles rather than silently
falling back to untrained optimization.

Include openings, early and late middlegames (quiet and tactical), queen, rook,
minor-piece, pawn, and promotion endgames, with both sides to move. Include
royal-losers searches if that variant will use the optimized binary. Keep books,
experience, and tablebases disabled when training search/evaluation code, and use
fixed hash/search options. This search-only workload does not exercise tablebase
decoder probing paths; assess tablebase performance separately before adopting a
production profile. Keep a separate held-out corpus with the same stage coverage
for measurement.

Keep the same source, compiler, build directory, and ordinary optimization
settings between profile generation and use. Save the training corpus and build
metadata with the profiles; start with a fresh profile directory when changing
source/compiler/LTO settings. To test PGO+LTO, repeat both PGO steps in another
build/profile directory with `-Dmaxima_lto=ON` from the start. Do not reuse the
plain PGO profile as evidence for the combined configuration.

Compare ordinary Release, LTO, PGO, and PGO+LTO only after builds and tests stop.
Pin identical C/C++ flags in all four configurations: compiler environment
activation can supply extra flags, while the ordinary presets clear them. The
examples above match the preset's empty additional flag settings.
Use repeated fixed-work searches and alternate execution order, preserving wall
times, search results, and variation by game stage and variant. Instrumented
engines are training tools, not performance candidates. Node/NPS reporting has
the limitations described in chapter 6.1; compiler optimization alone establishes
neither a speedup nor an Elo gain. Keep these build modes opt-in until measured.

See [GCC profiling](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html)
and [GCC optimization](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html)
for the underlying flags.

## 6. Testing and performance

Tests must return a nonzero exit code when a check fails, so both direct execution
and CTest detect failures. Detailed test output is available in
`build/cpp26/debug/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`. Use `cpp26_release` for
Release checks. When using the local toolchain, prefix these commands with
`.tools/bootstrap/bin/micromamba run -p .tools/cpp26`.

- Run checks appropriate to the change. For engine behavior changes, cover
  relevant move generation, make/unmake behavior, UCI commands, and search
  lifecycle scenarios.
- For concurrency changes, check cancellation, repeated searches, race
  conditions, and scaling across worker counts.
- Use sanitizer builds when investigating memory safety or undefined behavior;
  inspect diagnostics as well as test exit status.
- For documentation-only changes, review the content and diff; a build is not
  necessary.

Use identical Release compiler flags, positions, search limits, and hash size
for performance comparisons. Track nodes, NPS, and time to depth; only match
testing establishes a playing-strength gain. Test score bounds and cache reuse
as well as best moves. Keep regular tests offline and deterministic.

### 6.1 Position suites through UCI

Position benchmarks live outside the engine. The Python runner uses python-chess
through ordinary UCI commands; the `maxima` shell launcher dispatches tooling.
C++ correctness tests link the engine library, while lifecycle and suite runners
exercise the executable. No suite-specific UCI command or search hook is needed.

```bash
./maxima suite:run --movetime 1000
./maxima suite:run --nodes 200000 --json /tmp/modern.json
./maxima suite:run --suite /path/to/positions.epd --engine /path/to/engine
./maxima suite:run --suite /path/to/positions.epd --syzygy-path tablebases/syzygy
```

The default is `modern_2026`: 22 positions sampled from the 2026 Tata Steel
Masters broadcasts, one second per position and 64 MiB hash. Stockfish 19
labels were checked with two cold, single-thread MultiPV searches at two million
and eight million nodes. Targets must remain stable with at least a 50 cp margin
over the runner-up at both budgets and a final completed depth of at least 18.
The packaged manifest records sources, hashes, options, depths, scores and legal
PVs; source PGNs and offline provenance checks accompany it. Rebuild the corpus
with `runner/tools/build_modern_suite.py`; see the bundled suite README for the
exact command and limitations. JSON run reports include corpus and executable
SHA-256 hashes; a changed corpus or executable rejects the run report.

Use `--suite bratko-kopec` explicitly for the historical suite, now 22 positions:
BK.03 and BK.09 were removed following their disputed targets in
[this analysis](https://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=57166).
Original IDs are retained; the old 24-position totals are historical.
All expected moves remain diagnostic targets from finite analysis, not proofs
that every alternative is wrong or mandatory engine correctness assertions.
Position scores do not establish Elo; paired matches remain the strength gate.

The runner requires Python 3.8+ and pins the `chess` package from
[python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core.html).
Install the package and its dependency in the ignored runner environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .tools/runner
.tools/runner/bin/python -m pip install -e ./runner
```

On systems missing `ensurepip`, but with system pip available, use
`python3 -m venv --without-pip --system-site-packages .tools/runner` instead of
the first command. The launcher prefers this environment, falls back to the
legacy `.tools/suites` environment, then uses `python3`. The runner is also
installable with `python -m pip install ./runner`, providing a `maxima` command.
Help, build helpers, and the downloader do not import python-chess. Engine
execution through `./maxima` or the binary needs no Python.

The runner accepts standard EPD with one or more `bm` moves in **SAN** (such as
`Nf3`, `Bxe6+`, `O-O`, or `a8=N`), and still accepts legal UCI coordinate moves.
Moves are resolved against the position and normalized to UCI for comparison.
Ambiguous or illegal moves and invalid positions are rejected with a
line-numbered error before the engine starts. Castling uses the letter `O`.
Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored.

EPD operations can appear in any order. Quoted `id` labels are optional;
`hmvc` and `fmvn` preserve the halfmove clock and fullmove number, defaulting to
zero and one. Other operations are parsed and retained in the original EPD
report field but do not affect scoring: a nonempty `bm` is required, so
`am`-only suites are not supported. JSON includes canonical `expected_san` and
normalized `expected_moves`, along with the original `epd`. For example:

```text
8/8/8/8/8/8/4P3/K6k w - - bm e3 e4; id "pawn advance";
```

The bundled suite is package data under `runner/maxima_runner/data/suites/`.
Each position starts a fresh process in an empty temporary working directory,
so Maxima's automatic book and previous caches cannot affect results. Supported
options are set to hash 64 MiB (or `--hash`), one thread, one PV, no pondering,
no opening book, disabled analysis mode, zero draw contempt, and disabled Syzygy by default for a
search/evaluation baseline. To test the complete engine with local probing, pass
`--syzygy-path /path/to/tables`. The runner resolves the path before changing
working directories, requires WDL files, sets `SyzygyPath`, and sets the probe
limit to five when advertised. Engines without `SyzygyPath` are rejected when
probing is requested. Partial table coverage remains valid; uncovered positions
use normal search. Per-position output and JSON include `tbhits` (zero when no
hit was reported). The JSON report records engine identity and the options
actually applied. Other engines may have additional
book/tablebase options; inspect their configuration when comparing engines.

Only the final `bestmove` determines solved/missed. The report also records the
first observed expected PV move, latest primary-PV score/depth, engine-reported
nodes/time, and wall time until `bestmove`. Wall timing includes the initial
new-game readiness exchange; streaming observations use the runner clock. Reported depth/score can describe the
last completed iteration rather than the final interrupted search. Time/node
limits follow the engine's UCI implementation. Maxima reports visited nodes for
both telemetry and `go nodes`, and reports pruned moves separately in result metadata. Avoid equating node totals across
engines. Time comparisons also depend on hardware and compiler flags.

`--timeout` bounds response waits (default 30 seconds, extended to cover the
requested time budget). Protocol errors/timeouts return nonzero and clean up the
process. Unsolved positions are normal benchmark results and return success.
`--json FILE` saves the complete report after a successful run. Suite results do
not establish Elo; use engine matches for playing strength.

Runner tests exercise parsing, protocol handling, final-move scoring,
isolation, and timeout cleanup offline; they are separate from engine CTest.
The BK strength benchmark is deliberately run manually rather than enforced
as a build check.

### Offline paired-opening matches

```bash
./maxima match:run --engine-a /path/to/baseline --engine-b /path/to/candidate \
    --openings openings.json --pairs 2 --seed 2026 \
    --seconds 10 --increment 0.1 --pgn games.pgn --json results.json
```

Use `--variant losers` with royal-losers openings and two engines advertising
`Wild=losers`. Standard is the default. The opening file has this format:

```json
{"variant": "standard", "openings": [
  {"id": "open-game", "moves": ["e2e4", "e7e5"]},
  {"id": "queen-pawn", "moves": ["d2d4", "d7d5"]}
]}
```

Each entry may also specify a six-field `fen`; moves then start from that FEN.
Positions and move histories are validated before launching engines. Select at
most the number of distinct entries with `--pairs`. The fixed seed samples
without replacement; each opening is played twice with engine A assigned each
color. Fixed selection is reproducible, but clock-based searches and results
can vary. Both engines start fresh for every game in an empty temporary directory.
Applied options request one thread/PV, no pondering/book/analysis mode/contempt,
64 MiB hash (adjust with `--hash`), and no Syzygy probing or experience lookup when advertised. The report records
advertised options actually applied, identities, binary hashes, opening-file
hash, selected opening order, clocks, results, and terminations. Other engines
may require additional book/learning/tablebase configuration; inspect the
recorded options before accepting a baseline.

Use repeatable per-engine overrides to compare search settings or evaluation
backends with the same executable:

```bash
./maxima match:run --engine-a build/cpp26/release/src/maxima2 \
    --engine-b build/cpp26/release/src/maxima2 \
    --option-a LMR=true --option-b LMR=false \
    --openings openings.json --pairs 2 --seconds 10 --increment 0.1 \
    --pgn lmr.pgn --json lmr.json
```

Assignments use `NAME=VALUE`; quote assignments containing spaces. Option names
are case-insensitive, duplicate names are rejected, and explicit overrides must
be advertised by that engine. Checks accept only `true`/`false`, spins must meet
advertised integer bounds, and combos must match an advertised choice. Button
options are not supported. Both profiles are validated before either engine is
configured in each game. Hash, threads, PV count, pondering, variant, book,
contempt, analysis mode, Syzygy probe limit and experience controls belong to the
shared match policy; use `--hash` for the common hash size. Optional shared
settings are applied only when advertised, and their values are validated too.

For an external network, use `--model-b EvalFile=/path/to/network.nnue` (or
`--model-a`), rather than a plain `--option` assignment. This repeatable flag
accepts any advertised string option, sets an absolute file path before entering
the temporary engine directory, and records its SHA-256. `EvalFile` and
`EvalFileSmall` overrides require this model flag. File identities are checked
before configuration and after every game; a changed or missing model stops the
match, and a change during a game preserves an unfinished PGN/error record.
Output paths must also differ from model inputs. The JSON records requested
profiles and model identities at match level, plus applied settings, model
identities and advertised defaults per game. The runner cannot prove that an
external engine loaded the requested weights; use the engine's own load/parity
checks before strength testing. Embedded networks are identified by the engine
binary hash. Other default external files are not automatically discovered or
hashed; explicitly select them with model flags for reproducible comparisons.

For a baseline refresh after correctness fixes, finish the relevant native,
lifecycle, sanitizer and runner checks first, then freeze a clean revision with
its binary hash and build settings. Retain the previous frozen binary for
comparison. Freeze distinct variant-specific openings and match clocks before
running both color assignments; longer clocks can reduce short-clock artifacts.
Replay every PGN independently and inspect terminations, applied options and
pair uncertainty before using the corrected binary to judge strength candidates.
A completed small baseline match is not a strength promotion result.

Clocks use seconds plus a per-move increment. Wall time from the search request
through its response is charged, including readiness and runner overhead;
initial process startup/configuration is excluded. A late move loses on time,
except when the opponent has insufficient material under the selected variant.
Legal moves are verified before being pushed. Terminal outcomes and available
threefold/fifty-move claims are adjudicated by the independent board. There is
no evaluation-based adjudication. `--max-plies` (default 600 searched plies,
excluding the opening) leaves a nonterminal game unfinished, with result `*`.
`--timeout` bounds each protocol response (default 30 seconds); increase it for
long clocks. Protocol/illegal-move failures preserve the current game's partial
PGN and error record, stop the match, and return nonzero. Completed game records
are flushed as they finish; abrupt interruption may lose the active game.
Output paths must be new and distinct from each other and inputs.

PGNs preserve opening history, setup FEN, clock comments, result, termination,
and `Variant "Royal losers"` for losers. Use
`maxima_runner.matches.read_match_pgn(stream)` to replay these PGNs with the
correct board without changing python-chess's global variant registry. Generic
PGN readers may reject this variant; do not import these into standard experience.

For strength testing, use paired-result SPRT with bounds selected before play:

```bash
./maxima match:run --engine-a /path/to/candidate --engine-b /path/to/baseline \
    --openings openings.json --pairs 1000 --sprt 0 5 \
    --seconds 10 --increment 0.1 --pgn sprt.pgn --json sprt.json
```

`--sprt ELO0 ELO1` uses logistic Elo for A relative to B, with nominal false-positive
and false-negative targets of 0.05 each (`--sprt-alpha` and `--sprt-beta`). The
supported bounds satisfy `-200 <= ELO0 < ELO1 <= 200`; error targets must be
positive with sum less than one. Declare all parameters and the maximum number
of pairs before results. `--pairs` is a cap, and requires at least that many
unique opening entries. Each completed color-swapped pair contributes to one
of five buckets: LL, LD/DL, DD/WL/LW, WD/DW, WW, from A's perspective. Incomplete
pairs, engine failures and a lone first game cannot trigger a decision.

The logistic generalized SPRT estimates the paired outcome distribution under
each hypothesis. It stops after a whole pair when the log-likelihood ratio
crosses `log(beta/(1-alpha))` (accept H0) or `log((1-beta)/alpha)` (accept H1).
At the cap, a test without a crossing is explicitly inconclusive. H1 supports
the higher hypothesis against the lower; it does not certify a gain of at least
ELO1. H0 likewise is not proof of equal strength or regression. Error targets
are nominal model-based rates, not distribution-free finite-sample guarantees.
Generalized SPRT has asymptotic error control and assumes independent sampled
opening pairs and stable testing conditions. Larger independent confirmation
at longer clocks remains necessary before promoting a playing change.

Reports record hypotheses/error targets, model/provenance, five paired counts,
LLR, thresholds and decision. SPRT reports omit fixed-sample confidence intervals;
those are not valid after optional stopping. This mode is mutually exclusive
with Bonferroni checkpoints. Omitting both retains fixed-sample operation for
baselines and smoke checks. SPRT remains available for small-gain hypothesis comparisons;
existing historical match decisions retain their predeclared methods.
The same SPRT mode works with `--variant losers`: our independent royal-losers
board remains responsible for compulsory captures and variant terminal rules.
The official fast-chess v1.8.2-alpha executable supports standard/Chess960 only;
passing `Wild=losers` to an engine would not change its arbiter's rules. The
statistics port itself is independent of chess rules, so both variants can use
our existing match pipeline.
The isolated [fast-chess port](runner/maxima_runner/third_party/fastchess/README.md)
uses the upstream constrained multinomial likelihood, with a more precise
bisection solver and independent pinned Fishtest reference fixtures. Runtime
needs only the existing runner dependency. MIT attribution/license is bundled.
See [Fishtest mathematics](https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Fishtest-mathematics)
for the paired generalized SPRT model.

To stop on either a SPRT decision or evidence of a minimum gain, predeclare
`--sprt 0 10 --sprt-min-elo-stop`. The additional rule checks a simultaneous
confidence interval after every complete pair and compares it with the logistic
score corresponding to ELO1 (about 51.44% for +10 Elo). It stops with
`minimum_gain_established` when the lower bound is strictly above that score,
or `below_minimum_gain` when the upper bound is below it. The first condition
establishes at least the requested gain at the reported confidence level;
the second establishes a smaller gain, which can still be a useful improvement.
Whichever this rule or SPRT decides first ends the run. If both decide on the
same pair, the minimum-gain decision determines the stop reason. Each test's
own decision remains visible; `accept_h1` alone still does not certify ELO1.

Adding a rule requires allocating the error budget. Hybrid mode gives SPRT
half the requested alpha and beta, and the confidence bound an error budget
of `min(alpha, beta) / 2`. At defaults this is 0.025 for each SPRT target and
97.5% simultaneous coverage for the bound. By a union bound, positive errors
at ELO0 and negative errors at ELO1 retain the requested nominal overall targets;
the SPRT contribution remains asymptotic/model-based. Tightening its thresholds
can lengthen small-gain tests compared with plain SPRT. This is not a promise
of universally fastest stopping.

For a positive decision that must establish a minimum gain, use `--min-elo 10`
instead. It uses simultaneous 95% coverage and never accepts an ordinary SPRT
decision. All stopping modes are exclusive except the explicit SPRT hybrid flag.
Minimum gains must be finite within [0, 200] logistic Elo, always A relative
to B; put the candidate in A. Reports identify the mode, target score, minimum
Elo, allocated budgets, declared number of checks, bounds and stop reason.
A cap without a crossing is inconclusive; incomplete/failing pairs cannot stop.

The confidence rule uses pair scores in [0, 1] and radius
`sqrt(log(2 * maximum_pairs / bound_alpha) / (2 * completed_pairs))`.
Hoeffding plus Bonferroni controls all declared pair checkpoints, including
optional stopping. It requires representative random opening-pair sampling
and stable, independent playing outcomes; two games in a pair need not be
independent. Predeclare the cap and rules before fresh games, do not extend
the cap after inspecting results. The bound is conservative for small gains;
SPRT and confidence-bound decisions answer different questions.
See [Hoeffding's original bounded-sum inequality](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1963.10500830).

For optional early stopping, predeclare `--sequential-check-pairs N`. `--pairs`
then sets the maximum number of opening pairs; checks occur after every N whole
pairs and at the maximum. Each check uses a two-sided Hoeffding interval with
error budget `0.05 / ceil(maximum_pairs / N)`. The union bound (Bonferroni)
provides at least 95% coverage across the planned checkpoints under the same
opening-pair sampling assumptions as fixed-sample matches. Stop when the
adjusted interval excludes 50%; otherwise finish the maximum sample. This is a
conservative checkpoint rule, not SPRT, and does not establish equivalence when
inconclusive. For example, `--pairs 50 --sequential-check-pairs 10` allows five
checks over at most100games; each checkpoint interval has99% coverage. Reports
identify the checkpoint confidence, total confidence, stop reason and whether
stopping was early. A successful early stop has `complete=true` although fewer
than the requested maximum games were played. Interim noncheckpoint reports
have no interval. Omit the flag for the existing fixed-sample95% workflow; do not
use those unadjusted intervals to decide when to stop.
The bound follows [Hoeffding's inequality](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/Lecture2.pdf)
with an equal allocation of error across the predeclared checks.

JSON counts A's wins/draws/losses and unfinished games. The score estimate is the
mean of complete opening-pair scores, each game scored 1/0.5/0. The final 95%
confidence interval uses the conservative Hoeffding bound over pairs, retaining
within-pair dependence. It assumes independent pairs representative of the
opening population; narrow or biased opening sets limit conclusions. No interval
is reported until every requested pair finishes, avoiding interpretation of
partial or selectively completed runs as fixed-sample evidence. Small samples
have broad bounds; in fixed-sample mode these are score intervals, not Elo estimates or a sequential
promotion test. Unfinished games or engine failures return nonzero.

### 6.2 Bug audit and sanitizer checks

`test_uci_input` covers malformed FENs and moves, atomic preservation of position
and repetition history (including unsupported pawn counts), invalid option/search
values, unsupported Chess960/mate requests, special moves, compulsory losers
captures, and large-clock arithmetic. Lifecycle tests verify Chess960 is absent
from advertised options, ordinary castling still works after rejection, and mate
limits in either argument order preserve readiness and do not start searches.
An unsupported mate request stops an active search with exactly one prior result
and allows a subsequent supported bounded search.
Keep confirmed bug fixes accompanied
by focused regressions; passing the suite is evidence for its covered cases,
not a claim that the engine has no remaining bugs.
`test_uci_output` verifies that concurrent output preserves every message as one
complete line, including scheduling delays between payloads and newlines. It
also checks positive/negative cp and mate score bounds, zero/short elapsed-time
NPS, and unsigned 64-bit node/rate formatting. Deterministic root-reporting
checks cover interruption before/after a child evaluation, previous completed
iterations, partial aspiration bounds for both signs of cp/mate scores, and
visited/pruned counter separation. Raw-UCI checks cover standard/losers node
budgets, result provenance, fallback scores and book result authorization.
Search ownership checks cover preparation/worker delays; lifecycle checks cover
ordinary and zero clocks, bounded ponder/infinite requests in either argument
order, exactly one authorized bestmove, standard/royal-losers terminal roots,
book/tablebase shortcuts, and pause/resume deadlines on platforms with SIGSTOP/SIGCONT.
`test_leaf_search` checks both colors' mate/stalemate at quiescence depths 0,
-1, and -2, terminal score windows, captures reaching stalemate, quiet playable
positions, board/hash restoration, and losers terminal root score signs.
`testEvaluation` additionally checks the material lookup at sixteen pawns and
above its supported external range; lifecycle tests reject those FENs before
evaluating and searching the preserved position.
`test_search_tt_context` checks each king-attack weight independently and together
in both directions, all TT bound types, unchanged/rejected-setting reuse, and
draw-contempt context changes. Lifecycle tests compare completed warm and cold
UCI search scores after king-attack option changes and verify that changing either
weight safely stops an active search before another search begins.
`test_null_search` instruments artificial passes and endgame verification,
including consecutive-null exclusion, verification subtree exclusion, failed
verification, cancellation, reserved scores, pawn-endgame bounds, and state
restoration. Reserved-score tests inject search results through the virtual
PVS boundary and require no tablebase files.

`test_search_ceiling` checks both colors' mate/stalemate and playable checked
and quiet positions at the final stack slot, clocks 0/99/100/101, full/null
windows, standard PVS/quiescence and every losers mode, cold/seeded/disabled TT,
legal mate transitions, interrupted restarts, and board/hash/history restoration.
Synthetic placement isolates the boundary without claiming reachable histories
of that length; playable ceiling evaluations remain horizon approximations.

`test_search_boundary` uses independently generated python-chess certificates
for legal move sets, mating moves and clock-100 child results. It checks both
colors, full and null windows, mate distance, production defaults and individual
heuristics, cold/warm/disabled TT, parent clock-range propagation, interruption
and restart, and board/hash/history restoration. The certified trees terminate
after one reversible move; they do not establish general selective-search
equivalence or quiescence accuracy before a legal move reaches the draw clock.
Native checks require no python-chess installation. Regenerate or verify the
certificates with `python tests/data/search/generate_boundary.py [--check]` in
the runner environment, and review regenerated data before committing it.

`test_search_tree` checks PVS against independently generated two-ply legal
and minimax certificates, including arbitrary stable nonterminal leaf scores.
Its test subclass supplies the explicit leaf contract through the virtual PVS
boundary, stopping extensions at two plies. Null, beta, futility and LMR pruning
are disabled: this isolates window/bound handling rather than asserting accuracy
of the classical evaluator, quiescence or selective search. It compares every
certified legal move set, crosses cold/warm/disabled TT with full and bounded
windows, and checks state restoration and interrupted interior re-search restarts.
Verify certificates with `python tests/data/search/generate_tree.py --check` in
the runner environment; native checks need no python-chess installation.

`test_search_selectivity` observes production move-futility and LMR decisions
through synthetic child contracts at the virtual PVS boundary. Both null and
full PV windows cover reduced improvements, full-depth re-search, cancellation
and restart. Parent internal iterative deepening is isolated by the test
contract; real-search coverage remains separate. Independent
python-chess certificates supply both colors' legal moves, checks, captures,
promotions, castling and advanced passed pawns. It checks futility margins,
depth/check/endgame/mate exclusions, first-move retention and gain-based tactical
pruning; protected tactical improvements must still reach a cutoff. LMR checks
early and late move depths, dangerous-move exclusions, full-depth verification
of a refuted reduced improvement, cancellation in either pass and restart/state
restoration. These isolated guard probes disable node pruning and TT; they do
not certify selective-search equality, evaluation or real quiescence. Verify
data with `python tests/data/search/generate_selectivity.py --check`; native
tests need no python-chess installation.

`test_search_horizon` exercises real quiescence at depths 0/-1/-2 and PVS at
depths 0/1 on independently certified capture, recapture, promotion, en passant,
check-evasion and mate trees, including reversible clock 99. Its exhaustive
reference uses certified legal/tactical move sets and terminal scores, Maxima's
static stand-pat labels and its existing SEE-based check extensions. It has no
alpha-beta pruning, TT or move ordering; it does not independently validate
evaluation or SEE. The sparse fixtures assert the endgame exclusion from
quiescence capture pruning. Full/null windows, selective options enabled and
disabled, cold/warm/disabled TT, incompatible deep entries at quiescence entry,
real repetition histories, node-budget restart and state restoration are
checked. This is bounded search-integration coverage, not a general proof of
selective search. Verify certificates with
`python tests/data/search/generate_horizon.py --check` in the runner environment.
Native checks require no python-chess installation.

`test_search_review` checks independently certified both-color castling,
checking castles, attacked transit squares and check evasions at quiescence
0/-1/-2. Every legal child reaches the fifty-move draw boundary; production
stand-pat labels are an explicit shared dependency. It also checks exact-TT
PV truncation/legal text for both variants, missing-move entries, signed root
ordering biases, counters above 32 bits, saturation, sorting and complexity.
Production-default tactical fixture searches check exact warm reuse, disabled
TT, node-budget cancellation, fresh-state restarts and board/hash/history
restoration. Deterministic comparisons use identical selective settings;
they do not assert selective search equals exhaustive minimax. Verify the
castling certificates with `python tests/data/search/generate_review.py --check`.

`test_w17_tt_context` compares every royal-losers mate-search mode pair with
cold and disabled tables, both colors, reversible clocks, and repetition history.
It checks exact/lower/upper bounds, legal move hints, matching-mode reuse, and
incoming-mode identity across local horizon transitions.

Royal-losers playing evaluation deliberately remains material-only. The old
positional gate required material flag 16, which its classifier never produces.
The first restoration experiment added the existing pawn/king tables to ordinary
classes 3, 12 and 15, preserving specialized near-win material scores. Against
frozen ordinary Release `81f13b0`, 32 color-swapped opening pairs at 10+0.1 seconds
scored 27 wins, 14 draws and 23 losses (53.125%; conservative 95% opening-pair
interval 29.12–77.13%). This small screen did not establish a gain, so the
candidate was reverted under its predeclared rule. It does not prove the tables
are harmful. NNUE promotion requires separate correctness and match evidence.

The unused W17 positional tables and helper have been removed. Its future
positional evaluator will be a separately trained royal-losers NNUE. Standard
chess retains its existing classical evaluation as the default and comparison
baseline until standard NNUE passes correctness and measured strength gates.

`test_w17_evaluation` checks active material-only scores, classifications and
phase, both colors, cold/warm material caches, symmetry of the covered fixtures,
standard/losers material-cache separation, and board/hash/stack preservation.
King-only search terminals still precede static evaluation and draw clocks.

An address/undefined-behavior audit build can be configured independently:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/cpp26/sanitize -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined"
cmake --build build/cpp26/sanitize --parallel
UBSAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=1:print_stacktrace=1 ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build/cpp26/sanitize --output-on-failure
```

Use the local toolchain prefix and cache environment from chapter 5 when needed.
LeakSanitizer requires an execution environment that permits thread inspection;
the restricted workspace runner may require these checks to run outside its
sandbox. Inspect sanitizer diagnostics and exit codes. Race checking remains a
separate requirement for concurrency changes.

Private audit records and benchmark artifacts live under `.context/baselines/`.
Record the revision, dirty-tree status, binary hashes, positions, limits, build
configuration, and commands. A short benchmark does not establish a performance
or playing-strength gain. The 2026-10-10 audit adds zero-time, root-restriction,
book-shortcut, tiny-node, and losers terminal/draw regression cases.

Independent rule/state checks use `maxima_runner.variants.royal_losers_board`,
a python-chess subclass for [FICS royal losers](https://www.freechess.org/Help/HelpFiles/losers.html).
Hand-authored fixtures verify both colors' compulsory legal captures, pinned
captures, capture/quiet check evasions, legal/illegal en passant, all promotions,
orthodox castling, king-only/checkmate/stalemate wins, terminal precedence,
and ordinary claimable fifty-move/threefold draws. Insufficient orthodox mating
material alone does not adjudicate a losers draw.

`test_board_state` checks incremental hashes against freshly initialized boards
and restores bitboards, matrix, active board/history stacks, counters, castling,
en passant, and search-stack pointers after each legal child and an entire
repetition history. The test-only `tests/board_oracle_probe` target also serves
runner integration checks: fixed fixtures and sorted-move random games with
seeds 17, 2026, and 24301 compare complete move sets, every legal child's six-field
FEN, and repetition equivalence against python-chess for standard and losers.
The bridge does not add engine protocol commands. These sampled checks do not
prove exhaustive chess correctness or validate all search/draw/TT behavior.

## 7. CLI and local tablebases

### 7.1 Download command

Download complete Syzygy WDL and DTZ sets through the project command:

```bash
./maxima tablebases:syzygy:download --pieces 4
./maxima tablebases:syzygy:download --pieces 5 --dry-run
```

`--pieces` accepts 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, including kings; each selection includes
smaller tables needed for captures and promotions. The default is 4. The complete
three- and four-piece set is 70 files, about 4.14 MiB. `--dry-run` lists total
storage without downloading table files. `--directory /path/to/tables` selects
another destination; the default `tablebases/syzygy/` is ignored by Git.
Downloads check the mirror's published SHA-256 hashes, replace files atomically,
and verify/reuse completed files when rerun. The download command is part of
the Python 3.8+ runner and uses only the standard library; see chapter 6.1.
Running the compiled engine requires no Python.

### 7.2 Engine and UCI configuration

After a Release build, `./maxima` starts the engine (falls back to the Debug build
if Release is absent). Enable local tables with UCI commands:

```text
setoption name SyzygyPath value /absolute/path/to/tablebases/syzygy
setoption name SyzygyProbeLimit value 5
setoption name SyzygyProbeDepth value 1
isready
```

The path can contain several directories separated by `:` on Linux. An empty
path (`<empty>`) or a probe limit of 0 disables tablebase use. The initial engine
integration supports up to five pieces; six/seven-piece downloads are available
for later work. Missing tables fall back to normal search, and changing the path
stops the active search and clears cached search scores.

### 7.3 Probing policies

WDL probing supplies proven draw results and win/loss cutoffs at zero halfmove
clock. The depth setting limits probes at the highest available piece count;
smaller covered positions may be probed at leaves. Checked nodes retain normal
mate/evasion search. Root DTZ probing respects the current halfmove clock and
selects moves that make progress; ambiguous rounded results at the fifty-move
boundary fall back to search. With known reversible game history, the root also
keeps normal search because tablebases do not encode repetition history.
Tablebase wins/losses use large centipawn scores, not invented mate distances;
`info` output reports successful probes as `tbhits`. A root tablebase result
still waits for `stop` during infinite analysis or `ponderhit`/`stop` while
pondering before publishing `bestmove`.

### 7.4 Decoder dependency

The probing decoder is the MIT-licensed Fathom library, pinned in
`third_party/fathom/`. Keep upstream sources unchanged so updates remain
reviewable. Maxima's adapter, configuration, score handling, and search policy
live in `src/tablebase.*` and `src/search.*` and follow project conventions.

## 8. Roadmap

- Add incremental CLI documentation lookup (`docs:list`, `docs:search`,
  `docs:section`) using the stable chapters in this file. These commands are
  planned and are not implemented yet.
- Measure tablebase probing cost and strength before adding more probe heuristics.
- Extend root tablebase handling across reversible repetition history.
- Explore selective asynchronous online probes separately from local probing.
- Prepare shared caches and worker state for safe multithreaded search.
- Evaluate learned evaluation after the search and testing foundation is sound.

No speed or Elo gain should be claimed without the corresponding measurements.

## 9. Opening books and persistent experience

### 9.1 Playing configuration

The reference Polyglot book is read-only. `BookFile` defaults to `book.bin` in
its working directory; online clients should supply an absolute path. `OwnBook`
is now honoured: false disables both reference-book selection and experience.
`UCI_AnalyseMode=true` also disables them. These options affect future searches.

setoption name BookFile value /home/hermen/dev/qm2/book.bin
setoption name ExperienceFile value /home/hermen/dev/qm2/experience/experience.bin
setoption name ExperienceDepth value 16
setoption name OwnBook value true
```

Experience is optional, disabled until a file is configured. The engine loads a
validated immutable snapshot; changing `ExperienceFile` stops the current worker
before publishing a new snapshot. Reapply that option after importing new games.
`<empty>` disables experience. Invalid reloads retain the previous snapshot.
The engine never writes either the reference book or the experience file.

Only generated legal moves can be selected from either source. Experienced
positions with a previous occurrence of the root, imminent fifty-move draws, and covered
Syzygy material fall back to normal search/tablebases. Saved scores are never
used as transposition-table bounds or reported as proven evaluations. Book
moves report zero cp, as before. Infinite/ponder searches still wait for the
appropriate stop/ponderhit before publishing a book move.

### 9.2 Importing online games

Tooling uses the same pinned Python environment as the EPD runner (chapter 6.1).

```bash
./maxima experience:import --pgn games/BugChessFICS.pgn
./maxima experience:import --pgn completed.pgn --player Maxima --player BugChess
./maxima experience:show
./maxima experience:export
```

Defaults are `experience/experience.sqlite` and `experience/experience.bin`,
ignored by Git. `--database` and `--output` select other files. Snapshot export
refuses to overwrite an existing file without an experience snapshot header.
The reference `book.bin` is untouched. Imported games must be standard chess;
invalid games roll back the current import rather than partly changing statistics.

Default player aliases are Maxima and BugChess, matched without case sensitivity.
Only games involving an alias contribute results, but **both sides' moves** are
retained. An opponent's winning line is recorded as successful for that move's
side, rather than penalised because Maxima lost. Own and opponent provenance and
own win/draw/loss totals are stored separately. Scores count draws as half points.
These are observed results, not causal proof that an opening caused the outcome.

The default horizon is the first 32 plies (`--max-ply`). A position/move receives
at most one result observation per game, even if it repeats. Stable game identity
uses starting position, moves, result, and identifying PGN headers; importing the
same game again does not increase its counts. A later import may add stronger
annotations or extend the import horizon. Incomplete games (`*`) may contribute
analysis but do not count as wins/draws/losses. Completed results are treated as
authoritative; corrected game identities are not automatically reconciled.

### 9.3 Confidence and repertoire exploration

The importer keeps the counts as well as the percentages. Selection prefers
Maxima's own results when available. Own results start with 32 neutral prior
games: one win gives an estimated 51.5%, not 100%. Opponent-only observations
use 64 neutral prior games because player strength can differ. With more games,
actual results increasingly outweigh the prior.

Book weights are multiplied by `0.1 + 0.9 * (2 * estimated_score)^4`. This is a
first, unvalidated policy, not an Elo claim. The positive floor preserves trials
of less successful moves. Randomness uses an independently seeded generator per
search and is not reset every time the file opens. New observed moves get a small
trial weight growing with sample count. When sparse experience has no reference
book entry or qualifying analysis, it competes with a fresh search rather than
forcing a previously seen move. This lets both Maxima's and its opponents' new
lines enter the repertoire without treating one game as conclusive.

### 9.4 Remembering serious analysis

Annotated PGN supports standard `[%eval 0.40,18]` (White's score and depth) and
`[%emt 0:01:00]` (elapsed move time). Optional `[%nodes 1200000]` and
`[%pv e4 e5 Nf3]` comments retain effort and a legal SAN or coordinate PV.
A PV candidate is kept separately from the move actually played; unplayed PV
moves do not receive game-result counts. PV scores are attached only to their
first move, not copied into descendant positions. Engine identity comes from
WhiteEngine/BlackEngine headers, falling back to the player name. Unknown clock
annotations are not interpreted as elapsed thinking time.

Analysis retains score perspective, mate/cp type, depth, nodes, time, PV, engine
identity and halfmove clock. Stronger depth/node/time evidence replaces weaker
analysis for the same position/move/engine/clock. Engine versions remain visible
in the database. The compact snapshot exports the strongest record per move.
At a matching halfmove clock, analysis meeting `ExperienceDepth` (default 16)
can qualify an extra book candidate even without result observations. Candidates
must score within 50 cp of the best eligible saved analysis among legal moves;
analysed inferior continuations do not become recommendations merely because
they were examined deeply. Mate scores rank ahead of centipawn wins and behind
centipawn losses as appropriate. It remains
book evidence, not an exact score cache. A deeper recorded move can therefore
be available immediately in a later short game; this reuse policy needs match
validation and does not guarantee that past analysis was correct.

### 9.5 Optional post-game analysis

```bash
./maxima experience:analyze --pgn completed.pgn --movetime 1000 --max-ply 32
./maxima experience:analyze --pgn completed.pgn --movetime 60000 --max-ply 4
```

`--engine` selects an executable; default is the Release Maxima binary. The tool
starts an external UCI engine in an empty directory with book/experience disabled.
It analyses each position in the selected opening horizon and saves the best PV.
If its preferred move differs from the played move, it also searches the played
continuation and reports both scores and an estimated centipawn loss. This may
use two time budgets per position; differing search horizons can produce noisy
comparisons. Reports are candidate improvements, not proven mistakes. Analysis
candidates do not acquire invented wins or losses. Snapshot publication happens
when analysis completes. Result accounting remains a separate import command.

An online client can save annotated PGN at game end, invoke these commands, and
reload ExperienceFile before the next game. Automatic server connection,
background-job scheduling, and live UCI analysis recording are not implemented
here. The existing legacy `learn` self-match tuner is separate and is not used
by this persistent experience layer.

### 9.6 Storage and search ownership

SQLite is the authoritative writable store, used only by external tooling.
An atomic snapshot replace leaves readers with complete data. Snapshot format
v1 is little-endian: `MXEXP001`, an unsigned 64-bit record count, then sorted
80-byte records. Each has a full 64-bit Polyglot key, coordinate move (source six
bits, target six bits, promotion N/B/R/Q encoded 1/2/3/4), total W/D/L, analysis
depth/score/nodes/time/clock/type/engine fingerprint, own W/D/L, and a reserved
zero field. Duplicate or unordered records, bad headers, invalid field ranges,
incorrect lengths, and counts above two million are rejected.

Searches hold shared immutable ownership of the loaded snapshot. Lookups and
weighting occur only at the root, outside the search node hot path. Configuring
a file parses it once; ordinary searches do not reopen or modify it. Statistics
and analysis never change fifty-move/repetition identity or TT score semantics.
Tests cover confidence smoothing, both-side result attribution, duplicate and
repeated-position handling, stronger annotations, unfinished games, atomic
publication, legal selection, rejected reloads, OwnBook, and unchanged book bytes.


## 10. Python runner and project CLI

One repository contains two independently usable components: the C++ engine and
an installable Python runner. The engine owns search, evaluation, time allocation,
UCI handling, book/tablebase probing, and reading immutable experience snapshots.
It never imports, embeds, or invokes Python. The runtime boundary is UCI plus
existing book, tablebase, and experience files.

The runner uses python-chess for boards, legal moves, SAN/UCI notation, EPD, PGN,
Polyglot keys, and UCI process handling. Its `uci` module uses asyncio for engine
sessions, streaming analysis, response deadlines, cancellation, and bounded
shutdown followed by process reaping. Async operations can be awaited by future
server clients; ordinary CLI entry points run their event loop with `asyncio.run`.
Sessions accept ordinary `chess.Board` and `royal_losers_board`. Before search,
they select `Wild=standard` or `Wild=losers` when supported; royal losers requires
an advertised combo option containing `losers`. Unsupported board variants and
Chess960 are rejected before analysis. The losers board retains ordinary UCI
position transport and independent rule/terminal semantics. Offline matches
preserve variants in PGN export/replay.
Losers CLI suites, general PGN imports, and experience remain pending; those
workflows must preserve variant identity when introduced.
Generic UCI orchestration has no dependency on the Maxima source tree.
Maxima's SQLite experience accounting and binary snapshot serialization remain
in the runner's experience module; their formats are unchanged.

The CLI owns repository paths and build helpers. Existing `suite:run`,
`experience:*`, and `tablebases:syzygy:download` commands remain available.
Default engine selection prefers Release, falling back to Debug. Installed
commands discover the checkout from the current directory or
`MAXIMA_PROJECT_DIR`; outside a checkout, generic suite commands accept
`--engine /absolute/path/to/engine` and experience/download data defaults to the
current directory. Benchmark positions ship with the installed package.

```bash
./maxima build                 # configure and compile Release
./maxima build --debug
./maxima test                  # Release engine checks, then runner integration checks
./maxima test --debug
./maxima test --engine-only    # CTest, no python-chess required
./maxima test --runner-only    # runner checks against the selected built engine
./maxima uci                   # replace the CLI process with Maxima2
./maxima uci --engine /path/to/engine
./maxima uci --engine /path/to/engine -- --engine-option
```

`maxima uci` uses the Release engine, falling back to Debug. `--engine PATH`
selects another executable; relative paths resolve against the current directory.
Arguments after `--` pass unchanged to that executable, including `--help`.
This command requires only Python's standard library and uses `os.execv`, so
the engine inherits the process ID, working directory, environment, standard
streams, and normal signal handling. There is no persistent Python proxy and no
CLI banner or styling in protocol output. Launch failures report on stderr and
return nonzero. Use `maxima help uci` or `maxima uci --help` for command help.

Build helpers use the existing CMake presets and automatically use the local
micromamba compiler environment when present; otherwise they use tools on PATH.
Tests require an existing configured build and propagate failed commands' exit
codes. CTest contains engine correctness tests, including raw-UCI lifecycle
checks using the Python standard library. Runner tests are separate:

```bash
.tools/runner/bin/python -m unittest discover -s runner/tests -v
MAXIMA_ENGINE="$PWD/build/cpp26/release/src/maxima2" \
    .tools/runner/bin/python -m unittest discover -s runner/tests -v
```

Without `MAXIMA_ENGINE`, real-engine integration tests are explicitly skipped;
`./maxima test` supplies it and runs both layers. Runner test fixtures may use
raw UCI to assert engine-specific behavior; application code uses python-chess.
With the pinned python-chess version, malformed engine `bestmove` responses
may surface as logged protocol errors followed by the response deadline;
the runner still fails and reaps the process. Async lifecycle checks require
local socket access for asyncio's event-loop wake-up mechanism.

JDrone's Java implementation remains operational in its own existing checkout.
The next migration increment is FICS transport, game/clock orchestration,
automation, and PGN capture built on this async runner. ICC, legacy database
migration, remote control, and notifications are deferred. Learning writes stay
in Python; snapshot reading and move selection stay in Maxima.

### 10.1 Documentation and CLI interface

Update this document in the same change whenever implemented behavior, public
commands, configuration, architecture, or workflows change. Keep examples runnable
and distinguish available functionality from planned features. Private milestone
status, decisions, known bugs, and reproducible measurement records belong in
`.context/plan-maxima.md`; that file is ignored by Git.

The CLI follows the local Nimbly CLI's concise command summaries and section
separators, with a left-aligned ASCII crown above the Maxima name. It provides
the tagline "Chess engine & ops" and
`maxima --help` / `-h` for common
commands, `maxima help` for the full implemented command listing, and
`maxima help COMMAND` or `maxima COMMAND --help` for detailed usage, options,
and defaults. Build/test help includes examples. Current command groups are
engine operation, development, and chess data; online-play commands will be added
when implemented. Existing colon-style commands and the
no-argument native-engine launch are preserved.

Help must work without an engine build, credentials, network access, or optional
runtime dependencies. Invalid commands or arguments return nonzero with useful
guidance. Output must remain readable when redirected; any styling is limited to
terminals and respects `NO_COLOR`: the crown is gold, separators cyan, and titles
bold. Native UCI streams remain free of banners and styling. Detailed examples
for every data command remain a planned documentation improvement.
