 * Move Picker class to use by the search. The move picker handles move 
 * generation in phases, typically following this order:
 * - Hash moves
 * - Killer Moves
 * - Captures
 * - Quiet Moves
 * All moves returned are legal. If the move picker does not return any move, 
 * it's a (stale)mate.
